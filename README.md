Code for the paper: "Invertible CNN-Based Super Resolution with Downsampling Awareness" by Andrew Geiss and Joseph C. Hardin, Nov 2020



The 'data' directory containing the training and testing datasets and the 'models' directory containing trained keras models can be downloaded from google drive:

Code description:

data_manager.py - contains subroutines for loading image datasets, downsampling images, creating training batches, computing error metrics, evaluating CNNs on test sets

neural_networks.py - Definitions of the neural network architectures used in the paper

trainer.py - Script for training the CNNs

trainer_*.py - Scripts for performing additional experiments discussed in the paper (regularize alpha, incorrect downsampling assumption, HR and LR MSE loss)

plot_* - Plotting scripts for the figures in the manuscript. (These may require some modification to work on your system)

test_perf_table.py - Generates Table 1 from the paper



The 'figures' directory contains the plots from the manuscript and 'figures/model_diagrams' contains diagrams of the CNN architectures generated by the Keras 'plot_model' function
